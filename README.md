Material of video PE #73: Effect of Loop Delay in Voltage-Mode-Controlled DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/7YNfouszBzA

In this video we study the effect of the loop delay in the dynamic response of DC-DC converters. The loop delay further decreases the phase lag of the converter. This affects the phase margin of the converter, making it smaller and pushing the operation of the converter closer to the unstable region. Qspice simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.
